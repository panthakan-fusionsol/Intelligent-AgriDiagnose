Classify the attached corn leaf image into exactly ONE label from this closed set:
["rust","blight","spot","virus","mildew","healthy","abormality","brownspot","curl","smut"].
Use only visible evidence from leaf tissue; ignore watermarks, stamps, rulers, background, hands, tools, sky, or other plants.
If multiple leaves appear, decide by the most affected/dominant leaf region.
Choose the single best label even if uncertain; do NOT output multiple labels or explanations.

Tie-break decision rules (apply in order):
1) smut — ear/kernel blisters that turn black and sooty.
2) curl — young/top leaves notably curled/twisted and not unfolding (growth distortion).
3) rust — many raised, powdery, reddish-brown pustules.
4) blight — long, tapered necrotic lesions that may coalesce into streaks.
5) brownspot — numerous small, discrete, mainly round/oval brown lesions that stay separate.
6) spot — leaf spots that don’t clearly match “brownspot” and aren’t elongated blight streaks.
7) mildew — pale/yellow bands or striping in clearer longitudinal zones.
8) virus — mosaic/mottling: irregular pale patches mixed with normal green (not neat bands).
9) abormality — chemical/physiological injury (bleaching/whitening or irregular damage without pathogen-like structures).
10) healthy — no pathologic lesions, pustules, blisters, curling, or abnormal discoloration.

Output STRICTLY as JSON with a single field:
{"response":"<one label from the set above>"}
